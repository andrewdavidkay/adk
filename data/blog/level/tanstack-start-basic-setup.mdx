title: Tanstack Start Basic Setup

Create the Tanstack Start application.

```bash
npm create @tanstack/start@latest
```

An interactive prompt will start. My choices were:

```bash
What would you like to name your project?
level
```

Name your project whatever you want.

```bash
Would you like to use Tailwind CSS?
Yes
```

Seems standard nowadays.

```bash
Select toolchain
Biome
```

First I'm hearing of `Biome` but what the heck, let's try it out.

```bash
Select deployment adapter
Nitro
```

One of the main reason's I'm trying out Tanstack Start is I want to break free of the Vercel/Nextjs
lock-in. Plus I want to avoid serverless altogether. So I chose Nitro and will be hosting my app on
[Railway](https://railway.com).

```bash
What add-ons would you like for your project?
Drizzle, Shadcn, tRPC, Query
```

Use the spacebar here to select your add-ons.

I chose Drizzle because I've used it before and works fine. The other three selections I have not
used but want to learn. I will be documenting all my learnings as I go.

```bash
Would you like any examples?
none
```

The only option here is some sort of AI chat example. Miss me with that AI foolishness.

```bash
Drizzle: Database Provider
PostgreSQL
```

I am going to be using serverless (for now) for the db because [Neon](https://neon.com) makes things
easy to start and they run Postgres. Now you might be wondering why I didn't choose the `neon`
add-on. Well, last time I tried it it was broken and I'm not sure what it does anyways. So...yeah.

Now your initial app is setup.

Start the dev server.

```bash
cd [your-app-name-here]
npm run dev
```

Point your browser to http://localhost:3000 and you should see the basic index page. I set my dev
server to run on port 3001 because 3000 is running my blog.

I discovered a neat little debug feature while I was taking the above screenshot: if you hold
`CMD + shift` down it will tell you the file name and line number of the current element your cursor
is hovering over. Must be part of Tanstack's debug tools.

Now I'm going to make my first actual edit to the code base by deleting pretty much all of the index
page.

```typescript:src/routes/index.tsx
import { createFileRoute } from "@tanstack/react-router";

export const Route = createFileRoute("/")({ component: App });

function App() {
	return <div>Welcome to Level</div>;
}
```

Next I'm going to remove the header code and add my logo.

```typescript:src/components/Header.tsx
import { Link } from "@tanstack/react-router";

export default function Header() {
	return (
		<header className="p-4 flex items-center bg-white">
			<h1 className="ml-4 text-lg">
				<Link to="/">
					<img src="/logo.svg" alt="level logo" className="h-10" />
				</Link>
			</h1>
		</header>
	);
}
```

So now we've got our initial basic Tanstack Start setup with some basic first edits. Time to commit
our changes.

```bash
git init
git add .
git commmit -am 'initial commit'
```

Finally, make a new repo on GitHub and push your repo up.

```bash
git remote add origin git@github.com:andrewdavidkay/level.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```
