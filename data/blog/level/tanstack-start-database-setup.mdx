First, create a database at https://neon.com. I skipped the init command neon gives you so close
that pop up and then from your `Project Dashboard` click on `Connect` under the
`Connect to your database` section. Copy the connection string and open up your `env.local` file to
replace the placeholder string.

```text:.env.local
# Database URL for PostgreSQL
DATABASE_URL="paste your connection string here"
```

Test the connection by migrating your database with the demo schema already provided in
`src/db/schema.ts`.

```bash
npx drizzle-kit push
```

You should get an error. That is because we need to rename are `.env.local` file to just `.env`

```bash
mv .env.local .env
```

Run the push command again and studio command then open up drizzle studio at
`https://local.drizzle.studio` to view your database.

```bash
npx drizzle-kit push
npx drizzle-kit studio
```

Cool the database connection works! Progress. We can even add some data by going to
http://localhost:3000/demo/drizzle.
