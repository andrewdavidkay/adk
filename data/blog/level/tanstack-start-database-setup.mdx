First, create a database at https://neon.com. I skipped the init command neon gives you so close
that pop up and then from your `Project Dashboard` click on `Connect` under the
`Connect to your database` section. Copy the connection string and open up your `env.local` file to
replace the placeholder string.

```text:.env.local
# Database URL for PostgreSQL
DATABASE_URL="paste your connection string here"
```

Test the connection by migrating your database with the demo schema already provided in
`src/db/schema.ts`.

```bash
npx drizzle-kit push
```

You should get an error. That is because we need to rename are `.env.local` file to just `.env`

```bash
mv .env.local .env
```

Run the push command again and studio command then open up drizzle studio at
`https://local.drizzle.studio` to view your database.

```bash
npx drizzle-kit push
npx drizzle-kit studio
```

Cool the database connection works! Progress. We can even add some data by going to
http://localhost:3000/demo/drizzle.

I don't need the `todos` table so i'm going to `DROP` the table. In Drizzle Studio click
`SQL console` then run the drop statement.

```sql
DROP TABLE todos;
```

Next I'm going to tackle Auth but before I do that I'm going to tweak the header a bit with some
Tailwind.

```typescript:src/components/Header
import { Link } from "@tanstack/react-router";

export default function Header() {
	return (
		<header className="p-4 flex items-center bg-white">
			<div className="w-full max-w-2xl mx-auto">
				<h1 className="ml-4 text-xl font-semibold">
					<Link to="/">
						<img src="/logo.svg" alt="level logo" className="h-10" />
					</Link>
				</h1>
			</div>
		</header>
	);
}
```

There. Now onto onto Auth in the next post.
