title: Level 0 Setting Up Tanstack Start

Create the Tanstack Start application.

```
npm create @tanstack/start@latest
```

An interactive prompt will start. My choices were:

```
What would you like to name your project?
level
```

Name your project whatever you want.

```
Would you like to use Tailwind CSS?
Yes
```

Seems standard nowadays.

```
Select toolchain
Biome
```

First I'm hearing of `Biome` but what the heck, let's try it out.

```
Select deployment adapter
Nitro
```

One of the main reason's I'm trying out Tanstack Start is I want to break free of the Vercel/Nextjs
lock-in. Plus I want to avoid serverless altogether. So I chose Nitro and will be hosting my app on
[Railway](https://railway.com).

```
What add-ons would you like for your project?
Drizzle, Shadcn, tRPC, Query
```

Use the spacebar here to select your add-ons.

I chose Drizzle because I've used it before and works fine. The other three selections I have not
used but want to learn. I will be documenting all my learnings as I go.

```
Would you like any examples?
none
```

The only option here is some sort of AI chat example. Miss me with that AI foolishness.

```
Drizzle: Database Provider
PostgreSQL
```

I am going to be using serverless (for now) for the db because [Neon](https://neon.com) makes things
easy to start and they run Postgres. Now you might be wondering why I didn't choose the `neon`
add-on. Well, last time I tried it it was broken and I'm not sure what it does anyways. So...yeah.

Now your initial app is setup.

Start the dev server.

```
cd [your-app-name-here]
npm run dev
```
